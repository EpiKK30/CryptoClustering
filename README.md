# CryptoClustering Project

## Overview

The CryptoClustering project utilizes Python and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze and predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The project involves clustering cryptocurrencies using the K-means algorithm and optimizing the clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This README provides an overview of the project, the steps taken, and the results obtained.

## Repository Structure

- **CryptoClustering**
  - `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis and clustering process.
  - `crypto_market_data.csv`: Dataset containing cryptocurrency market data.
  - `README.md`: This document.

## Data Preparation

1. **Loading the Data:**
   - The dataset `crypto_market_data.csv` was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
   - Summary statistics and initial data plots were generated to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.

2. **Data Normalization:**
   - The data was normalized using the `StandardScaler` module from scikit-learn to standardize the features.

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - A new DataFrame was created with the scaled data, and the "coin_id" from the original data was set as the index for this DataFrame.

## Clustering Analysis

### Finding the Best Value for k

- **Elbow Method:**
  - The elbow method was employed to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for the K-means algorithm. This involved computing the inertia values for a range of k values (1 to 11) and plotting the elbow curve.

- **Optimal k:**
  - The optimal value for k was identified by visually analyzing the elbow curve.

### Clustering with K-means

- **Original Data:**
  - The K-means model was initialized with the optimal k value and fitted using the original scaled data.
  - Predicted clusters were assigned to each cryptocurrency, and a scatter plot was created using hvPlot to visualize the clusters based on 24-hour and 7-day price changes.

## PCA Optimization

- **Principal Component Analysis:**
  - PCA was performed on the original scaled data to reduce the features to three principal components. The explained variance was calculated to assess the amount of information retained by the principal components.

- **Clustering with PCA Data:**
  - The K-means clustering was repeated using the PCA-transformed data. A new scatter plot was generated to visualize the clusters with the PCA components.

## Visual Comparison and Analysis

- **Comparison of Elbow Curves:**
  - A composite plot was created to compare the elbow curves obtained from the original data and the PCA data, highlighting any differences in the optimal k value.

- **Cluster Comparison:**
  - Another composite plot was used to compare the cryptocurrency clusters from the original data with those from the PCA data, providing insights into the impact of feature reduction on clustering.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **API Call Limitation:**
  - During the data collection process, the OpenWeatherMap API call limit was unintentionally exceeded, preventing the acquisition of new data. To overcome this, the previously exported `cities.csv` file was used to complete the assignment.

## Results

The analysis revealed that the optimal k value differed slightly between the original data and the PCA data. The PCA optimization demonstrated that using fewer features could still effectively cluster the data while simplifying the model. The comparison of clusters highlighted the influence of dimensionality reduction on the clustering outcomes.

## Conclusion

The CryptoClustering project successfully demonstrated the application of unsupervised learning techniques to analyze and cluster cryptocurrency data. The use of PCA for feature reduction provided valuable insights into the clustering process. Future work could involve exploring additional clustering algorithms and further optimizing the PCA components.
